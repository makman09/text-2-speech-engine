## Text 2 Speech Engine Web App

This repo is an implementation of Tacotron 2 wrapped underneath a web application. I manage to generate a David Attenbourgh TTS model from training over 20 hours of labeld audio transcript data

### Current Goals

- [ ] Integrate [maximizing mutual information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01145.pdf) into the loss function
- [ ] Create APRAbet converter to break down text representation into lower dimensional phenome representation
